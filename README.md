Hi! I'm a Brazilian girl, 20 years, jobless, just studying whatever what feels interesting for me.
I've been studying programming since my high school, but I stopped because I thought programming it wasn't for me and I was used to hate web-programming, but It was in 2019, a lot of this world have changed and I'm willing to try it again. ^^

I bet this README's thing isn't for this kind of purpose but I thought if you're not my teacher seeing this project for an educational end, you're just being curious because I'm sure that It won't be uploaded until this month (july/2022), but, be my guest, I'm just typing in english here as a hobby.
